This is a simple C# console "Rock Paper Scissors" based game.


Rock paper scissors (also known by several other names and word orders) is an intransitive **two-player game** in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.

**RULES:**
The project allows to to play the game by choosing one of the three hand signs from the game.

The code is based on C#. Includes random genrator and text coloring.
